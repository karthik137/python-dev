# A string is a sequence of characters
# A string literal uses quotes, single or double
# For strings, + means concatenate
# When a string contains numbers, it is still a string
# We can convert numbers in a string into a number using int()


str1 = "hello"
str2 = "there"
bob = str1 + str2
print(bob)
